# Olympic Medals Predictor using Machine Learning

This project predicts the number of medals a country may win in the Olympics based on historical data and key features such as GDP, population, previous medal counts, and other socio-economic/athletic indicators.  
It uses **Scikit-Learn** with **Linear Regression** and other ML algorithms for comparison.
